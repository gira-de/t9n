## 1.0.0 🥳


This lib is designed to support developers as well as translators and make their life easier. It:

- 📖 Makes translation keys type safe.
- 🚨 Shows developers and other stakeholders if translations are missing.
- 👜 Makes it easy to create a list of all used translation keys and extract something translation agencies can work with (xlsx ftw 👍).
- 🛬 Allows seamless imports of new translations.
